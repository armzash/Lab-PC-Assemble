# Step by Step How to Assemble Computer Hardware based on PC Assemble
1) Remove back screws and take side cover off
2) Mount Motherboard - screw motherboard standoffs into the case
3) Mount Processor(CPU)- Locate the CPU socket holder on the motherboard
3) Install CPU Cooler
4) Install Power Supply (PSU)

# Reflection
This is my first experience with setting up computer hardware. I am always curious what component hardware is in a computer and what their function is. After this lab I know how to build computer hardware and what tooling to use.
In the lab, many feedback and discussions that students gave, and Dr. Haza gave a good response during this class. In future, if I have opportunity again to assemble PC, I want to assemble PC individually so I can better understand
